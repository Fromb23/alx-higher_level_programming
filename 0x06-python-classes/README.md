# 0x06. Python - Classes and Objects

## Background Context

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a new concept for all learners. It's crucial to read the provided resources and understand the principles of OOP in Python. Avoid copying and pasting; instead, type, test, and experiment to gain a solid understanding.

## Resources

Read or watch the following resources in the specified order:

1. [Object Oriented Programming](https://python.swaroopch.com/oop.html) (Read until the paragraph "Inheritance" excluded)
2. [Object-Oriented Programming](https://www.python-course.eu/python3_object_oriented_programming.php) (Read the specified paragraphs: General Introduction, First-class Everything, A Minimal Class in Python, Attributes, Methods, The __init__ Method, "Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, and Information Hiding," "Public, Protected, and Private Attributes")
3. [Properties vs. Getters and Setters](https://www.python-course.eu/python3_properties.php)
4. [Learn to Program 9: Object Oriented Programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDa-Z5JzLYM)
5. [Python Classes and Objects](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-classes-and-objects/)
6. [Object Oriented Programming](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/object-oriented-programming)

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain:

- Why Python programming is awesome
- What is OOP and "first-class everything"
- What is a class and what is an object/instance
- The difference between a class and an object/instance
- What is an attribute and how to use public, protected, and private attributes
- The concept of "self" in Python
- What is a method and the special __init__ method
- Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, and Information Hiding
- The concept of a property and the difference between an attribute and a property in Python
- The Pythonic way to write getters and setters
- How to dynamically create arbitrary new attributes for existing instances of a class
- How to bind attributes to objects and classes
- What is the __dict__ of a class and/or instance and what does it contain
- How Python finds the attributes of an object or class
- How to use the getattr function

## Copyright - Plagiarism

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- Files interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
- Files should end with a new line
- The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A README.md file at the root of the project folder is mandatory
- Code should use pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
- All files must be executable
- Length of files will be tested using `wc`
- Modules, classes, and functions should have documentation (real sentences explaining their purpose)
- Documentation length will be verified
